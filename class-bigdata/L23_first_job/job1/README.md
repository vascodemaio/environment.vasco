# Your very first job

Please, write a job script that is capable to execute any bash script of your choice by accepting two command line arguments:

- the first: the bash script you want to execute
- the second: the argument to be passed on the bash script you are executing

Write the bash script you will use for this exercise in a way that selects only the lines of the file "records.txt" which contain the category "cat2" and saves them on a new file.

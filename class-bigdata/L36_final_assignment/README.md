# Final Assignment

## Dataset

The file `L36_dataset_epigenomics.tsv` contains a dataset with the following variables:

- methylation_level: level of methylation of different genomics regions
- H3K36me3_level: level of methylation of Histone 3 Lysine 36 of different genomics regions
- H3K27ac_level: level of acetylation of Histone 3 Lysine 27 of different genomics regions
- H3K4me1_level: level of methylation of Histone 3 Lysine 4 of different genomics regions
- H4K16ac: level of acetylation of Histone 4 Lysine 16 of different genomics regions

## Assignment

Please analyse this dataset using the most appropriate methods. Prepare a report discussing your choices step by step, and presenting a data-driven justification for the analytical decisions you made.

Provide evidence, if appropriate, of relationships of dependencies in the dataset, explaining how some of the variables might influence your findings.

Discuss in the report, where appropriate, any biological background which might support your findings.

Use the most appropriate computing environment to carry out this work, and explain the code and the choice you made in a dedicated section of the report.
